--| Littering took place at 16:36. No known witnesses.

--This leads me to look at the activty from the bakery logs at around 10:00 and the liscence plates as well, none of this was enough information to find anything therefore I need to take a step back.

--Having the same person interview twice seems suspicious so I am going to check what he said.
--Eugene said "I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
--Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money."

--Now I have to find the people who have actually own the accounts by joining the tables where names and account numbers are located.

--Now we have 8 suspects. They are Bruce, Diana, Brooke, Kenny, Iman, Luca, Taylor, Benista.

--Now lets look again at what Raymond said.
--"As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
--In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

--The first obvious stick outs are that the phone call lasted less than a minute, earliest flight, someone else purchased.
--First we find that the airport located in Fiftyville is abbreviated CSF.

--Of course, flights and airports are not the same table so we are going to need to join them where the origin airport is both fiftyville.

 --Now lets cross reference from our original list: Bruce, Luca, Iman and Diana.
 --The names that are the same are Bruce and Luca (ofc it has to be 2 :( ), therefore one of these two are the one who commited the crime.

 --Now we just hvae to find out who he called because that person will be the accomplice.
